Hello! I'm a sophomore at [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/), intending to double major in mathematics and music.

**Mathematical Interests**
------
I'm interested in any and all mathematics, but I'm partial to categorical methods of understanding things. For this reason, I especially enjoy homological algebra, algebraic topology, and homotopy theory. I am obsessed with modules. Recently I've become interested in how geometric/topological methods can be applied to non-geometric objects, such as in [the analogy between knots and primes](https://www.julianlyczak.nl/seminar/knots2016-files/knots_and_primes.pdf).

I am also very passionate about mathematics education. For the 2023/24 school year, I taught the advanced math class at the [Jewish Middle School of Nashville](https://www.jmsnashville.org/). I was also a counselor at the 2025 [PROMYS](https://promys.org/) summer program (where I was a student in 2023 and 2024). Both experiences were life-changing, and I'm always looking for opportunities to share my excitement about math with others.

**Musical Interests**
------
I've played the cello for about sixteen years, and I particularly enjoy Baroque music and counterpoint. My favorite composers are Bach, Dvořák, and Shostakovich. I also have several years of vocal training, primarily in Ashkenazi Jewish liturgical music, although I have an ongoing interest in Mizrahi traditions as well.

**Other Passions**
------
- I am an avid basketball player, and am always excited to run a game of pickup.
- Reading! I primarily read non-fiction, although I also love fantasy novels with interesting magic systems. My favorite author is, by far, [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/).
- Family is very important to me. I have two younger brothers, and a girlfriend with whom I've been with for three years.
